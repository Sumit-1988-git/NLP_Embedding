# 📚 **NLP Embedding Techniques – Step-by-Step Guide**

Welcome to a hands-on repo exploring core **text embedding techniques** in NLP! Here you’ll find Python code and notes for Bag of Words, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText—all with practical, ready-to-run examples.

## 🛠️ What’s Inside?

1. **Setup & Data Prep**
   - Import all the must-have libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `gensim`, etc.)
   - Load a sample text dataset.
   - Preprocess text: cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal.

2. **Bag of Words (BoW)**
   - Convert text to a word-count matrix using `CountVectorizer`.
   - Check out word frequencies and matrix sparsity.

3. **TF-IDF**
   - Transform text with `TfidfVectorizer`.
   - See how TF-IDF scores highlight important words.

4. **Word2Vec**
   - Train your own Word2Vec model using Gensim.
   - Visualize and interpret word vectors.

5. **GloVe**
   - Use pre-trained GloVe embeddings or train your own.
   - Map your dataset words to GloVe vectors.

6. **FastText**
   - Train FastText embeddings (captures subword info!).
   - Compare FastText to Word2Vec and GloVe.

## 🤖 Why Embeddings?

Text embeddings are 🔑 to modern NLP—they turn raw words into numbers that machine learning models *understand*. This repo demystifies the most popular techniques, side by side.

## 👨‍🔬 For Learners

- All code is modular and easy to tweak.
- Great for assignments, mini-projects, or demos.
- Clear comments to help you understand *what* and *why* at every step.
